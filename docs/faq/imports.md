# 1. Can I import my data?

Yes, you can import your data into XAuth. To ensure seamless integration and maintain the highest security standards, the XAuth developers will handle the data migration process for you.

To request data import, please contact the XAuth developers through the official Discord server. They will guide you through the necessary steps and ensure that your data is securely and accurately imported into the system.

By entrusting the data migration process to the XAuth developers, you can be confident that your data will be properly sanitized, encrypted, and imported while adhering to the best practices and security standards.

Please note that since XAuth is a different solution, some data may not be directly importable or may require additional processing. The XAuth developers will work with you to determine the best approach for importing your data while maintaining its integrity and security.
